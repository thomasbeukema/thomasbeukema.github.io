        <p>So, re:Invent 2022 just ended, and I attended for the first time. I thought it was awesome and I’m really grateful for the fact that I was able to attend. Before departure I did my research on how to get the most out of it and I found some tips and tricks. Therefore, now that I have first-hand experience, I thought I should share some tips and tricks of my own.</p>
<h2>Before you go</h2>
<p>First of all, you should try to get your ticket and flight sorted as soon as possible. I was quite late with this (late October), which meant that 1) all the hotels were booked, so I had a hotel which was quite far from the venues and 2) a lot of sessions were reserved before I had the chance to claim a spot in the event dashboard. </p>
<p>Speaking of reserving sessions, I’d recommend making as much reservations for sessions as you are able to. That said, don’t be afraid to include some walk-up sessions in your agenda. From what I read online was that walk-up sessions provide a terrible experience. However, if you are 20 minutes to 15 minutes early to a session, you are almost guaranteed a spot. The thing is that you have to wait for a bit outside, however I found those waiting times a welcome pause between all the sessions.</p>
<p>So, what kind of sessions do I recommend? I’d recommend to take as much <strong>chalk talks</strong> as possible, since these are not recorded. The breakout sessions as well as the keynotes <em>are</em> recorded. In spite of this, break out sessions are also really valuable, since you can ask the presenter questions afterwards, which you can’t do online. Now, before I went I read that you shouldn’t go to keynotes, as these are recorded and you can’t ask questions afterwards. Now that I went to re:Invent, I’d recommend going to <em>one</em> keynote, at least. I should warn you, they are about two hours, but I am still glad I went to the keynote of dr. Werner Vogels. It is a nice experience to go to a keynote, so pick one which is most interesting to you and go. You can read the gist of the other keynotes online later on.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is to travel light, and make sure you leave enough empty space in your luggage for the gigantic amount of <em>SWAG</em> you’ll receive.</p>
<h2>The venues</h2>
<p>Re:Invent takes place in a handful of hotels in Las Vegas. The list of venues include <em>The Venetian</em>, <em>Caesar’s Forum</em>, <em>Wynn</em> and <em>The Encore</em>. I really underestimated how far these are apart, so I had my sessions spread out in all of them each day. This was not really practical, as I found myself racing from one venue to another by foot and it really takes a lot of time. However, there are shuttles, but the traffic in Las Vegas ensures that you’d be quicker to walk between most of the venues. I took one shuttle to MGM Grand, since this was far away from when I was then and I ended up being 10 minutes late to the session I wanted to attend. In short, try to cluster sessions at the same venue, otherwise prepare for <strong>a lot</strong> of walking.</p>
<h2>The nights</h2>
<p>During the daytime I attended the sessions, but during the night time, I attended a lot of parties. If you’re into it, there are a lot of parties organised by all kinds of different companies and AWS themselves. I’d highly recommend to visit at least a few parties, since they’re fun and you get to know a lot of new people. It was definitely impossible to party every night and also attend the sessions I set out to attend in the morning. Therefore, I had some evenings where I chose just to re:charge (😉). Thursday night there was the biggest party of the week: <em>re:Play</em>. Even if you’re not that into partying I highly advise you to visit it. There is way more than just partying going on there, so everyone will have a great time.</p>
<h2>Other tips &amp; tricks</h2>
<ul>
<li>I found it really nice to eat lunch at the lunch place every day. This will take some more time than just to take out your lunch, but you will have tastier food and, more importantly, it allows you to take a break and reflect upon what you have learned during the sessions in the morning. So after lunch, you can fully focus on the sessions you have planned in the afternoon.</li>
<li>I’d recommend you go that before you go to re:Invent, you obtain at least one certification. Even if it is only the cloud practitioner. It will open a lot of doors for you and you get some certified only <em>SWAG</em>!</li>
<li>Don’t get your badge at the airport. The lines are incredibly long. Instead, just get up really early on Monday and get it at the Venetian. If you go early enough, you will be able to directly get your badge and <em>SWAG</em> without a line.</li>
<li>Register at re:Invent with a plus addressed email address. Something along the lines of thomas+reinvent@thomasbeukema.me. This will allow you to filter out all emails you get from companies you let your badge scan afterwards.</li>
