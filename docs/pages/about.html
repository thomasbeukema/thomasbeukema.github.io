    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am Thomas Beukema. I am a 21 year old, living in Utrecht, The Netherlands. I've lived here for a little over two years now. I moved here from Noordwijkerhout, The Netherlands, because I started studying at Utrecht University.</p>
<h2>What keeps me busy?</h2>
<p>The main thing which fills my days at the moment is my study. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree, majoring in Information Science at Utrecht University. Next to that, I work part-time at VodafoneZiggo, one of the biggest telecom providers in The Netherlands. I work here as a cloud engineer enabling other teams within the company to make use of public cloud (mostly AWS). In addition to this, I started a boat rental company with two friends in the summer of 2022 (Terrasboot). This is mainly busy during the summer, when weather is good. Finally, I'm also very interested in politics and I've become a member of a political party to actively pursue my political ambitions.</p>
<h2>And in my free time?</h2>
<p>In my free time I play football at VSC in Utrecht. Apart from this, I do fun things with friends, I read a lot, play the occassional game and also try to work on side projects.</p>
